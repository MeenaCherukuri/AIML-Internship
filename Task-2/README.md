# Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Titanic Dataset🚢
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous [Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.
## 📌 Objective
To understand and visualize the Titanic dataset by:
- Generating summary statistics
- Identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies
- Visualizing relationships between features
- Making basic feature-level inferences
## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Google Colab
## 🗂 Dataset
We used the Titanic dataset provided by Data Science Dojo:

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Google Colab**.
2. Run the notebook cells step-by-step.
3. All necessary visualizations and inferences will be displayed in the output cells.
## 📊 EDA Highlights
- Summary statistics: mean, median, std, etc.
- Histograms and boxplots for numeric variables
- Correlation heatmaps and pair plots
- Pattern analysis based on:
  - Age
  - Fare
  - Gender
  - Passenger class (Pclass)
## 🧠 Observations & Inferences
- 💰 Passengers paying higher fares tended to belong to higher classes and had better survival chances.
- 👶 Children and younger passengers had relatively higher survival rates.
- 🚹 Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- 🛳️ First class passengers were more likely to survive than those in third class.
